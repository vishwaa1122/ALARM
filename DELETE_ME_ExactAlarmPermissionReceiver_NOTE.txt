This project previously had an ExactAlarmPermissionReceiver BroadcastReceiver that listened for\nandroid.app.action.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM_PERMISSION_STATE_CHANGED and auto-rescheduled alarms.\n\nAt the user's request, that receiver and its manifest entry were removed to simplify the app.\nIf you ever want this behavior back, you can restore the ExactAlarmPermissionReceiver.kt file\nand re-add the manifest <receiver> block.
